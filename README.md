> _We shut down our company, but we‚Äôre open-sourcing the code so others can learn, build, and benefit. Read the full story: [Why we started (and ended) this company](https://blog.hash8m.com/startedcompany.html)._

## Project Objective

meen.co was built to streamline talent discovery and candidate management, leveraging advanced LinkedIn profile crawling and AI-powered search. Our goal was to make it radically easier for teams to find, analyze, and engage with top talent‚Äîautomatically.

Although the company is no longer active, we believe the technology and ideas behind meen.co can help others, so we‚Äôre releasing everything as open source.

## LinkedIn Curling: The Highlight

The LinkedIn crawling (‚Äúcurling‚Äù) system is the heart of meen.co. Here‚Äôs what makes it special:

- **Smart Caching:** Profiles are fetched from LinkedIn via Proxycurl, then cached in the database for fast, repeated access.
- **Rich Data:** We pull not just the basics, but skills, inferred salary, emails, phone numbers, and social profiles.
- **AI Embeddings:** Each profile is converted into a vector embedding, enabling semantic search and matching.
- **Image Handling:** Profile pictures are fetched and stored as base64, so you can display them instantly.
- **Similarity Search:** Find the best candidates for any query using vector similarity, not just text matching.
