            <description>Question:  What does a CIO who has a degree in literature and a passion for writing do next?
Answer : He becomes Chief Content Officer at Canada's leading IT publisher.
If you saw the press release, you will know how thrilled I am to announce this new role and a new chapter in my career.   So now my profile will read...
CIO and Chief Content Officer at IT World Canada (ITWC) - Publisher of IT World Canada,  CIO Canada, IT Business, Computer Dealer News (CDN) , Network World Canada and Direction Informatique (DI).  Also the leading events organizer in Canada.  
My role is to work with a first class team of writers and journalists to transform ITWC from the best IT publisher to the best content provider in the technology arena.
As we have grown the whole concept of content as a service - I will be spending my time leading the development of our digital content capabilities.   
On another related front and with a separate company, I've also assumed the duties of Chief Content Officer of Amazing Agency - A story telling, content driven agency that will serve a wider range of companies who know that in a world where content equals consideration, telling stories in the new digital media is the route to success in the digital social world we live in.</description>

            <description>Do I ever luck out on great jobs!  When IT World Canada asked if I would be their CIO, I couldn't say no.

Between that, being CIO/CTO for three other companies and teaching at the Conrad School at Waterloo, I have the trifecta of the three coolest jobs I've ever wanted.</description>

            <title>Facilitweet</title>
            <description>Facilitweet allows you to facilitate public twitter or even private chats.  It exploits the beautiful unstructured discussion and brainstorming encouraged by twitter and chat programs.  It allows a facilitator and the participants to organize and analyze the results using affinity analysis techniques.  It records and reports the discussion for future reference. 
It has a myriad of uses.  In education or presentations, it allows the facilitator an additional channel where the participants can provide feedback and responses which don't simply drift off into the ether.  They can be organized, analyzed and reported on. 
In online discussions, it allows the leader and the participants to find patterns in the discussion, "vote" or prioritize items and sort through the clutter of a discussion to find the core of what is there.  
For both structured and unstructured chats of all kinds, it allows for analysis at a deeper level.  Moreover, that analysis can be done by a single facilitator or be a collaboration between all participants.</description>

            <description>Canoe is community radio at its best.  I'm so pleased to support this unique voice in the Halburton community where I live.  (I commute to Toronto)  I'd done a number of things with Canoe.  They played the song I wrote "Carolyn and I" in support of the flood fund-raising.  I got to play just before Blue Rodeo for the thrill of my life.  And now I'm working on a radio play cum variety show with a talented group of local players.  What a thrill.</description>
