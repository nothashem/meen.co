    <summary>ML Engineer by day creative by night. I want to drive end to end systems for worthwhile missions. I am an incurable creative, and intensely curious, constantly sprouting ideas and I enjoy discussing opportunities/problems worth solving with simple, elegant ML and software. I enjoy knowledge sharing, I am advocate for best practices and breaking down silos. Only looking to make my small corner of the world a better, kinder place.
My evenings are spent taking photos, writing music or dancing. Formerly the sole owner of a small business and a multi-media producer, I have trained and led teams of entertainers and worked in production teams that sold million $$$ shows to top TV Networks and A-list talent. I left entertainment production because I missed tech and needed a new challenge.</summary>
